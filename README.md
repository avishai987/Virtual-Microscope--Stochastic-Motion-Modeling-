In the realm of immunology, understanding the interactions between molecules is 
crucial for comprehending the intricate mechanisms of immune response and 
cellular signaling.  
Understanding the intricate interactions (especially over time) between the 
molecules:  CD45, LCK, and TCR is vital for unraveling the complexities of T cell 
signaling and immune response regulation. They can have profound implications for 
immune system function and can contribute to various immunological disorders.  
Due to the limitations imposed by the size of single molecules in relation to the 
wavelengths of light, visualizing and tracking them using even advanced light 
microscopy techniques, such as confocal microscopy, is extremely challenging. 
Additionally, time-resolved imaging becomes sluggish, impeding the observation of 
complete sequential motions. Considering these constraints, our primary objective is 
to improve the temporal resolution or frame rate of synthetic or real microscopy 
time-series comprising individual molecules. To achieve this, we plan to leverage 
prior statistical and physical knowledge. By employing these methods, we anticipate 
enhancing the resolution and smoothing the transitions between frames. 
Our project is a software toolbox consists of two key components. The first 
component utilizes advanced algorithms to enhance the resolution of input image 
sequences, resulting in higher-resolution movies that closely resemble reality. This 
enhancement enables a more detailed and accurate representation of molecular 
motion captured in microscopy time-series. The second component focuses on 
generating synthetic movies that realistically simulate molecular motion. Leveraging 
sophisticated algorithms and techniques, this feature produces synthetic movies that 
closely mimic real-world scenarios.
